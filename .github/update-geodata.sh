# Upstream is MetaCubeX/meta-rules-dat's cn.list rather than the
# 1715173329/IPCIDR-CHINA pair r46 shipped.  Measured against the APNIC
# delegated statistics, the old lists missed 62,927,616 CN IPv4 addresses
# (18.2% of everything APNIC has allocated to CN) against cn.list's 1,519,872
# (0.44%); the two largest gaps were the Beijing Telecom backbone blocks
# 59.192.0.0/21 and 175.48.0.0/21, so destinations resolving into them missed
# the mainland rule and went to the proxy.  cn.list is also slightly *more*
# precise (99.22% of what it lists is CN, against 98.92%).  It stays pure CIDR
# text so the nft set and the generated route rule-set keep reading one file,
# and it is a file in a git repository so the router's blob-id check still
# applies.  Full comparison in docs/cn-ip-source-benchmark.md.
